# Android-IOS-Data-Analysis
This is a Jupyter Notebook where I compare and analyze two separate datasets (IOS &amp; Android) to find insights on how certain apps perform in the market.

Both datasets are included as .csv files, 'AppleStore.csv' & 'googleplaystore.csv'

I have included comments to guide the viewer through the analysis. Feel free to perform further analysis, I used python in the Jupyter Notebooks environment.
